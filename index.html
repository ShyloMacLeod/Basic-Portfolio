                    <p>I was born in California but moved to Utah when I was 6 where I spent the remainder of my childhood. When I was 18 I met my husband and we married 8 months later. I received my associates in general studies 18 years ago. The following year I had the 1st of our 4 children and I have been a stay at home mom ever since. Now that my youngest is in school I am looking to get back into the workforce.
                    <p>In my free time I love to go to the gym, enjoy photography and digital scrapbooking/photo editing. My hubby and I are pretty much concert junkies...there really is nothing like live music! We both have very eclectic taste in music, so it makes it hard not to go to every concert that comes to town. I also enjoy pretty much anything outdoors including, but not limited to hiking, camping, boating and four wheeling.</p>
